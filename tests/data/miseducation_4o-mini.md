# THE MIS-EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO

## CHAPTER I

### THE ROOT OF THE TROUBLE

The "educated Negroes" have the attitude of contempt toward their own people because in their eyes as well as in their mixed schools Negroes are taught to admire the Hebrews, the Greeks, the Latins and the Teutons and to despise the Africans.

Of the hundreds of Negro high schools recently examined by an expert in the United States Bureau of Education only eighteen offer a course telling the history of the Negro, and in most of the Negro colleges and universities where the Negro is thought of, the race is studied only as a problem or dismissed altogether.

For example, a doctor of a Negro university, thinking that an additional course on the Negro should be given, called upon a Negro Doctor of Philosophy of the faculty to offer such work. He promptly informed the doctor that he knew nothing about the Negro. He did not go to school to master him that way. He was educated in a

system which diminishes the Negro as a nonentity.

At a Negro summer school two years ago, a white instructor gave a course on the Negro, saying for his last work which teaches that whites are superior to the blacks. When asked by one of the students why he used such a textbook the instructor replied that he wanted them to get that point of view. *Free schools for Negroes* - they are places where they must be convinced of their inferiority.

The thought of the inferiority of the Negro is drilled into him in almost every class he enters and in almost every book he studies. If he happens to have school after he masters the fundamentals, before he finishes high school or reaches college, he will usually escape some of this and may recover in time to be of service to his people.

Practically all of the successful Negroes in this country are of the uneducated type or of a few Negroes who have had no formal education at all. The larger majority of the Negroes who have been to the schools bear the marks of educational trauma which is a written into the soul of their people. It after learning, the Negro had the opportunity to grow, the Negroes that teachers of the race could live to do so, but the result has been that they have become a con-

... an active force in the development of the race. 

The so-called school, then, becomes a questionable factor in the life of this deprived people. 

As another has said, in handicapping a student by teaching him that his black face is a curse and not all of it to blame for the condition of hopelessness in the realm of lynching. 

*If one does not apprehend and despair him to vagabondage and crime. In striking, then, that the friends of truth and the proponents of freedom have not risen up against the present propaganda in the schools of Central. This sounding note has been important in the anti-lynching movement, because there would be no lynching if it did not exist in the schools.*

*Why not amoid, censor, or establish a clear line?*

*That merely to restrict or suppress is to be more stupid or may be to be part of the trouble. Our most widely treated scholars have been trained in narrowest circles of the South. Northern and Western institutions, however, have not time to deal with matters which concern the Negro especially. They may direct their attention to the problems of the majority of their constituents, and some of them have stimulated the problems by referring to the thoughts found in history, economics, literature,*
