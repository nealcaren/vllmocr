# THE MISEDUCATION OF THE NEGRO

## CHAPTER I

The "educated Negroes" have the attitude of contempt toward their own people because in their own as well as in their allied schools Negroes are taught to admire the Hebrew, the Greek, the Latin and the Teuton and to despise the African. Of hundreds of Negro high schools recently examined by an expert in the United States Bureau of Education only eighteen offer a course in the history of the Negro, and in most of the Negro colleges and universities where the Negro is taught, or, the race is studied only as a problem or dismissed as of little consequence. For example, an effort to establish a Negro university, thinking that an additional course on the Negro should be given, later called upon a Negro Doctor of Philosophy of the faculty to start work. Historically informed the older that he knew nothing about the Negro. He did not go to school to mate his life that way. He was to be educated in a

system which dismisses the Negro as a society.

At a Negro summer school two years ago, a white instructor gave a course on the Negro, using for his text a work which teaches that blacks are inferior to the blacks. When asked by one of the students why he used such a text book the instructor replied that he wanted them to get that point of view. From school for Negroes, this is the place where they must be convinced of their inferiority.

The thought of the inferiority of the Negro is drilled into him in almost every class he enters and in almost every book he studies. If he happens to have a white teacher of mathematics, being he seldom high school or college graduate, will naturally accept the dictum of his teacher and may recover in time to be thoroughly whitewashed.

Practically all of the successful Negroes in this country are of the traditional type or of that of Negroes who have had no formal education at all. The large majority of the Negroes who have put on the darkening lenses of our best colleges are an but worthless in the development of their people. If after leaving school they have the opportunity to give out to Negroes what touches of the race world the white man has taught, but they never become a constructive force.

Disruptive force in the development of the race. The so-called school, then, becomes a contributory factor in the life of this despised people.

At another but will add, in advance of the student by teaching him that his black face is no certificate of intellectual or moral inferiority.

It will confirm the conviction that wrong is being done, if not in purpose, at least in result. Its broad and comprehensive watchwords and cries. It is strange, then, that the friends of truth and the promoters of freedom have not risen up against the present propaganda in the racial and criminal fields.

The crude is as much more important than the intellectual, because here we shall be no needing if it did not start in the schoolroom.

Why not exploit, analyze, or determine a class that everybody is taught to regard as inferior?

To be more explicit, because we know it is the seat of the trouble. Our most widely known scholars have been trained in universities outside of the South. Northern and Western institutions, indeed, have had no line to deal with matters which concern the Negro especially. They must direct their attention to the problems of the majority of their constituents, and too often they have eliminated the perspective of refining to the Negro as a negative or nonentity consideration.

Most of what these universities have offered as language, mathematics, and science may have served a good purpose, but much of what they have taught as economic history, literature, re-
