Brown Accuses Nixon of Bidding For Rightist Aid in Coast Race
By FELIX BELAIR Jr. Special to The New York Times.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 -- A fear of communism had caused many Californians to lose sight of the "danger of a dictatorship of the right," Governor Edmund G. Brown of California charged former Vice President Richard M. Nixon today with courting political support of the John Birch Society and other "radicals of the right."
Governor Brown, a Democrat, told a National Press Club audience that right-wing extremists had become a strong political force in California and now threatened to take control of the Republican party organization. He said the Young Republicans of Los Angeles County recently elected as president the protege of a John Birch Society member.
While there was no evidence that Mr. Nixon was a member of the ultra conservative organization, said Governor Brown, "the real problem is that he is not joining the fight against the ultra right wing -- although these extremists are a strong force in our state and in his party."
"Mr. Nixon, however, appears on the same platform with Birch candidates and assures them 'There is room in the Republican party for people who differ,'" the Governor added. "He goes further. He promises to support them if they win in the primaries."
The Governor has yet to announce whether he will seek re-election.
"If I run, I want no support either extreme," he told his luncheon audience.
