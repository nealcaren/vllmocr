# 'GRANDFATHER CLAUSES.'

## Prof. Du Bois Tells of Discriminations Favoring Whites

*To the Editor of The New York Times:*

In the article on "A Negro Disfranchised" in THE TIMES of Oct. 30, your special writer says:

"The law provides that elections shall be held without regard to race, color, or previous condition; but the conditions set are so hard that few colored voters can meet the tests and many of them self-disenfranchise themselves."

This is not a fair statement of the case. By the well-known "grandfather clauses" ignorant white men have been given the life-long hereditary right to vote if their fathers voted, while on the other hand colored men were disfranchised.

Further than that, qualified colored men able to meet every legal requirement are denied registration practically at will by registrars. Just how this method of disfranchisement is actually accomplished may be illustrated by the following case: A colored graduate of Harvard, who proved himself for registration in a particular State, writes:

"On the proper day I made application to the Registrar of the town of ---- for registration. The Registrar was a young white man of the newer class growing a bit disgruntled at my correct answers as they were store in turn. He handed me a piece of paper and told me to make and my signature. I complied. He glanced at it carefully and then handed me a sheet of paper containing five questions. These questions asked the manner of election, term of office, and duties of some of the State officers. I answered all but a small portion of one of the questions correctly with the exception of one and that was partially right. When I had finished he took the paper and looked at it for about a second, and then, shaking his head, said: 'You can't register.' I asked why, and he replied, 'You haven't answered these questions.' I asked, 'Did I give wrong answers?' He said 'No.' I asked him to tell me. I said you can't register, and that settles it."

From Louisiana we learn:

It is lately announced that the negroes have nearly all deserted the parishes of Louisiana. Mr. ----, whose address is ---- Parish, Louisiana, is a graduate of Straight University, carrying on his own farm, valued at $10,000, yet he cannot participate in any election.

From North Carolina a friend writes:

The amendment, as you know, was not adopted for the improvement of the electorate. The whites are as divided on matters of voting—and the opposition among the dominant race can gain at almost as great a sweep against their opponents in white voting as toward any others—and these, being naturally sensitive and little inclined to court trouble, simply do not register and vote. I think this sunset of the race in matters political will have to continue until that spirit their patriotism steps.

The result in the disfranchisement of intelligent property-holding negroes is shown by these figures from Louisiana:

1900—Population .................... 725,512 650,804  
1900—Male adults 21 years of age.. 178,885 147,348  
Illiterate ...................... 83,816 118,425  
1908—Registered voters ............ 22,576 96,962  
1908—Registered voters ............ 153,153 1,743

Yet the negroes of Louisiana have increased in value of their farms from nine to thirty-six—third to twelve and a quarter of millions and in other values in ten years have shown the general school system in America have reduced their illiteracy in the same time from 72 to 61 per cent.

Your correspondent writer thinks that such improvement works no injury to the Nation. "The white folks are in the saddle" down South, just as they are "up North," and there they expect to stay, watching the regeneracy of parties "this blessed Union." This sounds gay and snappy, but let us for a moment face some plain facts:

Minnesota and Alabama each sent nine Congressmen to Washington in 1908. The First Congressional District in each State votes as follows:

Pop. White  
First Dist. Alabama........ 181,724 7,497  
First Dist. Minnesota...... 246,375 93,877

How is it that 1,000 voters in Alabama have the same power as 35,000 in Minnesota?

It is because 22,234 voters in the First District of Alabama were black and disfranchised, in spite of the fact that 9,000 of them could read and write of the same district. These disfranchised negroes were interested enough to go to the polls because there is no political question in Alabama on which people vote except the "Negro" Question.

Here, then, is the real menace to "this blessed Union."
