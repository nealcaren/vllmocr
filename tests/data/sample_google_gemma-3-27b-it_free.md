**“GRANDFATHER CLAUSES.”**

**Prof. Du Bois Tells of Dis- criminations Favoring Whites**

*To the Editor of The New York Times:*

Sir: It is somewhat curious that a dis- cussion in North Carolina, Oct. 26, over *white* suffrage qualifications should set the matter in such a light as to practically exclude from view the systematic dis- criminations which were meant to defeat the enfranchisement of the Negro.

The whole matter of the so-called "grand- father clause" is a plain and deliberate attempt to give the right to vote to poor, ignorant whites who could not pass the intelli- gence tests, but denying the same right to Negroes who had been long subjected to the disabilities of slavery. 

On the one hand, the intelligence tests are laid down as a means of weeding out the unworthy voter. On the other hand, a provision is made which practically exempts from these tests those who fought in the Civil War or whose ancestors fought in earlier wars. This is admittedly devised to let in ignorant whites and keep out ignorant Negroes. It is a deliberate attempt to disfranchise one race and enfranchise another. Such a law is an insult to the nation and to democracy.

**From Louisiana we learn:**

“*The North Carolina law is modeled after the original Grandfather clause in Louisiana’s Constitution of 1898.*”

**And earlier—**

“*The original law was designed to allow white citizens who were not qualified under the Constitution’s educational and property requirements to vote if their ancestors had voted before 1868.*”

***And the interesting part of this is how well the law operates:***

1000 white men have registered under the “Grandfather clause” in Louisiana in the last year.
 ***But***
 Only four Negroes have registered. 

This, sir, is not a matter of accident. It is a matter of careful and systematic discrimination. As a matter of fact, the number of Negroes who are descendants of voters before 1868 is undoubtedly greater than the number of whites. But the law is administered with such care that it practically excludes Negroes.

It is a striking illustration of how democracy is being distorted in the Southern States, and it deserves the attention of the nation.
