# THE MIS-EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO

## CHAPTER I

### THE MIS-EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE

The "so-called Negroes" have the attitude of contempt toward their own people because in their own as well as in their allied schools they are taught to admire the Hebrew, the Greek, the Latin and the Angles-Saxon, but are filled with disdain for the African. Of the hundreds of Negro high schools recently examined by an officer in the United States Bureau of Education only nine offer a course dealing with the history of the Negro, and in most of the Negro colleges and universities where Negroes are taught, the tuition of the race is studied only as a problem or discussed as of little consequence. For example, as an offer of a Negro university, thinking that an additional course on the Negro would be attractive, a Negro Doctor of Philosophy of the faculty offered some work, it was regarded that his doing so was out of place - it did not go the way. As he went to be educated in a

system which disintisates the Negro as a socia-
city. As a Negro summer school two years ago, a
white instructor gave a course on the Negro, using for his text a work which teaches that
whites are superior to the blacks. When asked
by one of the students why he used such a book
the instructor replied that he wanted them
to get that point of view, because the Negroes
then, he says, would know where they must be
convinced of their inferiority.

The thought of the inferiority of the Negro
is drilled into him in almost every book he studies. If
he happens to leave school before he finishes the
elementary grades, he is doomed unless he happens to
have one of those rare radical, liberal, or humanitarian teachers who was uneffected by the tears and
self-pity which are deeply planted in the soil of his
very being.

Practically all of the successful Negroes in
this country are of the educated type or are
the intermixture of the white and Negro
race. The large majority of Negroes are poor
and have not been able to get the opportunity to be
educated at all. The large majority of the Negroes
who have lost, as on the banking boards of our
best colleges are all but worthless in the development of their people. If after leaving
school they have the opportunity to give out to
Negroes what they have learned of the facts of
life, they are living at teaching or preaching what they
have been taught, but they never become a con-
structive force.

# The Seat of the Trouble
Stirring force in the development of the race. The so-called school, when, becomes a considerable factor in the life of this despised people.
* All another has, still this building is boating a
strong one. The most difficult enemy to be seen by white folks here at the South is the negro. He not only knows by nature how he has been treated, but he knows by experience that the condition of his race is the worst sort of lynching.
It kills one's aspirations and hopes to see vagabondage and crime. It is strange, then, that the friends of truth and right and progress of freedom dare not raise their voice against the present propaganda in the schools.
* Cruelty is much more important than the existing. Moving movement. Everything there should be in the schoolroom. Why not ancient schools, or universities of high rank, today everybody is taught to regard as inferior?
* To be more specific in what you said as the cause of the trouble. The most widely known scholars have been trained in institutions outside of the South. Southern and Western institutions, however, have had no time to deal with matters which concern the Negro especially. They must direct their attention to the preparation of the country's young people, and too often they have stimulated this prejudice by referring to the Negro in a cursory manner of consideration. Most of what these universities have offered as history, geography, mathematics, and science may have served a good purpose, but some of what they have taught as economics, history, literature, and the like have hampered the progress of the Negro.
