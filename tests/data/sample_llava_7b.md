# Markdown syntax cheatsheet

## Headers

Headers are defined using one or more hash characters (`#`, `##`, `###`, and so on). The number of hash characters indicates the header level.

```
# This is a Heading

## This is a Subheading

### This is a Sub-subheading

#### This is a Sub-sub-subheading

```

## Emphasis and Links

Emphasis can be created using asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`). The number of characters used determines the strength of emphasis.

```
*This text will be italicized.*
**Or this text will be bold.**
***Or use both for even stronger emphasis.*****

[This text is a hyperlink](http://example.com)

```

## Lists

### Unordered lists

Unordered lists are created using asterisks (`*`) or plus signs (`+`).

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

+ Item 1
+ Item 2
+ Item 3

```

### Ordered lists

Ordered lists are created using numbers followed by a period and a space.

```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

```

## Images

Images can be included in Markdown using the following syntax:

```
![Alt text](image-url)

![Alt text](/path/to/local/image)

```
