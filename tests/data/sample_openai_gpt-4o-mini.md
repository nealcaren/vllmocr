WASHINGTON, Jan. 8. — Gov. Edmund G. Brown of California charged former Vice President Richard M. Nixon today with courting political support of the John Birch Society and other "radicals of the right."

Governor Brown, a Democrat, told a National Press Club audience that right-wing extremists had become a strong political force in California and now threatened to take control of the Republican party organization. He said the Young Republicans of Los Angeles County recently elected as president the protégé of a John Birch Society member.

While there was no evidence that Mr. Nixon was a member of the ultra conservative organization, said Governor Brown, "the real problem is that he is not joining the fight against the ultra right wing—although, these extremists are a strong force in our state and in his party."

A fear of communism had caused many Californians to lose sight of the "danger of a dictatorship of the right," Governor Brown said. He added:

"All of this placed Richard M. Nixon in a position where he must choose between principle and opportunism. He has chosen the latter. He has stepped away from those who are fighting the political primitives, and he apparently wants their money and their support."

The Governor has yet to announce whether he will seek reelection.

"If I run, I want no support from either extreme," he told his luncheon audience. 

"Mr. Nixon; however, appears on the same platform with Birch candidates and assures them 'There is room in the Republican party for people who differ.' He goes further. He promises to support them if they win in the primaries."
