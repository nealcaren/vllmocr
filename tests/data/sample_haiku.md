# 'GRANDFATHER CLAUSES,' 
Prof. Du Bois Tells of Discriminations Favoring Whites

*To the Editor of The New York Times:*
I in the article on "Grandfather Clauses," in THE TIMES of Oct. 30, your special writer says:

*"The law prescribes the qualifications of all voters, and these may be, and in Virginia, they are, conditions so hard that few colored voters can meet the test--revenue-producing taxes, educational tests, good character, etc."*

This is not a fair statement of the case. By the well-known "grandfather clauses," ignorant white men have been given the life-long hereditary right to vote, while negroes born in the South are often unable to meet every legal requirement and denied registration, although if they were white they would be registered by virtue of their fathers' votes. A further result, says a leader in the voting case: "A colored graduate of Harvard University, who offered himself for registration in Virginia, writes me:

'On the assumption that I had violated a law, I was handed a piece of paper and told to make my petition. I filled the paper, stating that I had never been convicted of a felony, was not under curatorship, had paid all taxes, and could read and write. This I did in proper form. It was carefully filled in a courteous manner and handed the clerk, who looked at it a moment, saying "You do not seem to be on the list. Your registration will be denied."'"

From Louisiana we learn:
It is loudly announced that "in the negro's home towns in Louisiana, the negroes are forever being registered." In spite of this, a friend in North Carolina writes:

*"The amendment, as you know, was not adopted for the betterment of the disfranchised, but simply to deprive all negro voters of the State, by adding a poll tax and educational qualifications which the majority of negroes cannot meet. Should they attempt to vote, they are simply not registered and told that this point in their exclusion stops."*

The result of the disenfranchisement of intelligent property-holding negroes is shown by these figures from Louisiana:

1900--Population .....................727,362 105,915
1920--White 21 years and over......333,567 35,484
Illiterates .............................55,395 50,652
Negro 21 years and over..............321,849 70,431
Illiterates..............................129,342 65,252

Yet the negroes of Louisiana have increased their number from one-quarter and one-third to twelve and one-third per cent of the total vote, and this in face of the fact that in America the negroes have reduced their illiteracy to 3.2 per cent.

Your special writer thinks that such exclusion, "The whites are in the saddle, and there they expect to stay, whatever the United States may say and do." This is the history of the disenfranchisement of the negro in the South and the way they expect it to stay. But let us for a moment face some plain facts.

Minnesota and Alabama each sent nine representatives to Washington in 1903. The First Congressional District in each State votes as follows:

      Dist. Alabama     Dist. Minn.
1900--Voted ............1,154 5,107
1920--Voted...........202,101 32,151

"How is it that 7,000 voters in Alabama have the same congressional representation as 32,000 voters in Minnesota?

"It is because 22,234 voters in the First District of Alabama were disfranchised, in spite of the fact that they could read and write, because there were not enough of them to enable them, under the laws of Alabama, on which people vote except the "negro" question."

"How is this for Democracy?" writes a correspondent of THE TIMES. The committee of the Association for the Advancement of Colored People, New York, Nov. 2, 1912.
