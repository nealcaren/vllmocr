# THE WOMAN REBEL
(No Gods, No Masters)
Vol. I   May 1914   No. 1

## THE AIM

The aim of The Woman Rebel is the emancipation of women, and in this aim, we are met by obstacles established by those who have power to make laws and to interpret them. The subjection of women is decreed by the social system, and it is upheld by law upon the statute booksâ€”of States and Nations. It is defended and supported by Church, State, and institutions, political, economic, and social. It has become so ingrained that it is accepted as natural, and the habit of submission has become a part of the mental attitude, not only of the women themselves, but of men.

The woman of today is bound, circumscribed and suppressed, and above all, she is economically dependent on man, either father or husband, for her livelihood. She has no independent status, and therefore she cannot hold radical views or become revolutionary - for radical views and revolutionary tendencies must mean the loss of economic support and may even bring about ostracism from the social group. 

All this clearly indicates that the subjection of women cannot be eradicated so long as she is economically dependent, and that the root of the evil is economic. We must strive, therefore, to make woman economically independent, to make her feel that she can stand alone and without the financial support of a man, and that the greatest asset she can have is that of self-reliance. She must be made to realize that marriage, instead of being a haven of peace and security, is very often but barter and sale, and that her economic dependence makes it so. This fact, together with the social attitude and the laws, all tend to intensify the subjection of woman.

The object of The Woman Rebel is to awaken the consciousness of woman and to make her realize that she must depend upon herself for her economic freedom and for her emancipation from social and moral shackles. It is a challenge to the Almighty God in Heaven and the God of the Church, and the God of the Bible, and all the pious frauds that keep woman in subjection. The Woman Rebel stands for the right of women to live their lives as they choose, and not as any religious, political, or social clique wishes them to do. In the language of the Bible, "The Truth will make them free." And this is the truth about women that The Woman Rebel aims to spread.

The Woman Rebel is not a militant publication, whatever that term may mean. It believes in open warfare, rather than in secretive and surreptitious methods. It will not condone acts of violence, whether physical, economic, or moral. It believes that violence and outrage only intensify disorder and confusion, and that the only pathway to freedom is through Education, Organization, and Revolution.

The Woman Rebel demands the abolition of the institution of marriage, and the complete independence of woman, economically, socially, and morally. It stands for the right of a child to be born without the bloodstain of marriage which is at present a stigma upon the brow of every illegitimate child, and which, until it is eradicated, keeps the mother in a subordinate position. It believes that the establishment of the principle of the equality of the sexes, and the economic independence of women, is essential. The Woman Rebel goes further and demands the control of the sex-life of the individual and the right to make motherhood voluntary and free instead of being compulsory and enforced. 

The Woman Rebel is above all a moral revolution. It challenges the whole scheme of morality set up, not for the development and freedom of the individual, but for the maintenance of the patriarchal institution and the supremacy of the male. And as such it will have the support of all the new feminists, whose minds are not darkened by prejudices and distorted by the slimy tentacles of old beliefs and customs.

# WHY WAIT?
## MARION HOWARD

Whatever the World's Fair's advertised purpose may be, its real significance lies in its effect upon the minds and sentiments of all who come within its influence.

The World's Fair is an expression of the civilization of the time. It reveals the achievements, the ideals, the aspirations of a people.

What it will do to the millions who will visit it is still a matter of speculation. Will it inspite them to greater things, or will it merely satisfy their curiosity?

# LITTLE SINGERS AND HANGED
## SOLDIERS AND CRIMINALS

Wherever you go, you will encounter two groups that have a special interest in the World's Fair - the little singers and the hanged soldiers and criminals.

The little singers are the children who have been trained to sing and dance and perform for the delectation of the visitors. Their services have been donated by their parents, who see in this an opportunity for their children to obtain recognition.

The hanged soldiers and criminals are those who have paid the supreme penalty for their transgressions against society. Their bodies have been given to science and medicine, to be dissected and studied.

In both cases, human beings are being exploited for commercial purposes. Their very existence is denied in order that others may profit.

What a strange commentary on our civilization that we can do these things and yet pretend to be moral!

# TO BE A WOMAN REBEL
## ELIZABETH KLINE

The woman's choice in life is not an easy one. She has been taught that her place is in the home, that her career is that of wife and mother. She has been led to believe that anything else is unnatural, unfeminine, a betrayal of her sex.

But the world is changing. More and more women are rebelling against the restrictions that have been placed upon them. They are striving to find a place for themselves in the sun, to use their talents and abilities in ways other than those prescribed by a male-dominated society.

To be a woman rebel is not an easy thing. It means going against the grain of centuries of tradition. It means facing the scorn and ridicule of those who cannot understand. It means being willing to sacrifice personal happiness for the sake of a greater good.

But it also means the thrill of achievement, the satisfaction of knowing that one is making a contribution, the joy of self-realization.

To be a woman rebel is to be a pioneer, a trailblazer. It is to face the unknown with courage and determination. It is to be willing to take risks, to defy convention, to challenge the status quo.

It is not an easy path, but it is a path that is being followed by an ever-increasing number of women who are unwilling to accept the limitations that have been placed upon them.

To be a woman rebel is to be a part of the great movement for social change that is sweeping the world. It is to be a participant in the struggle for the emancipation of all humanity.

It is a challenge that is not for the faint of heart. But for those who are willing to accept it, it is a challenge that can bring a sense of purpose and fulfillment that is unmatched by any other.
