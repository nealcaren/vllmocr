## Prof. Du Bois Tells of Discriminations Favoring Whites

To the Editor of The New York Times:

In the article "Jim Crow Disenfranchised," in THE TIMES of Oct. 30, your special writer states:

"The law prescribes the qualifications of all voters equally, but owing to various constitutional amendments adopted in the Southern States, the overwhelming majority of white men cannot be denied the vote."

This is not a fair statement of the case. By the well-known "grandfather clauses," ignorant white men have been given the life-long hereditary right to vote, while Negroes who had complied with every legal requirement and had actually passed the most rigid examination that local officials could devise were deliberately disfranchised.

A further fact, which it is carefully omitted, is that a colored graduate of Harvard, Yale or any other Northern university, if he happens to live in Virginia, writes:

"On the ground of illiteracy we are disfranchised - the Registrar is a young white man of the intelligence-test degree; while our intelligent Negroes, farmers, artisans and laborers, who have been denied the chance of an education, are not allowed to register." 

This is not proper form. He had carefully asked me a series of questions, term of office, date of the next election, etc., and found that I could answer the questions correctly with the exception of one and then was told that I had flunked and could not register.

The result of the disfranchisement of intelligent property-holding Negroes is shown by these figures from Louisiana: 

- 1900—Population ............................ 1,381,411
- 1900—Voters ...................................222,811
- 1920—Voters ...................................106,525

Yet the Negroes of Louisiana have increased their numbers from three-quarters of a million to a million. How is this for Democracy? The facts are known to the Director of the Census and to the Director of Public Affairs.

New York, Nov. 2, 1912.
