# 'GRANDFATHER CLAUSES.'

## Prof. Du Bois Tells of Discriminations Favoring Whites

To the Editor of The New York Times:

In the article "The Negro Disenfranchised," in The Times of Oct. 30, you refer to the so-called "grandfather clauses." *The law prescribes* the qualifications of all voters. In some States these qualifications are made so difficult for the negro that few can meet them, while at the same time **the "grandfather clause" exempts from these requirements all persons who were voters, or whose ancestors were voters, prior to a certain date.** This is not a fair statement of the case. **By the well-known "grandfather clauses" ignorant white voters have been given the life-long hereditary right to vote, while negroes, no matter how intelligent, are denied this right before the courts.**

Further than this, the statutes declare that all qualifications required by law shall be enforced "without discrimination" as to "race, color or previous condition of servitude." But this "without discrimination" has not been possible. In the leading case it has been shown by a colored graduate of Harvard, who offered himself for registration in Virginia, whites were registered who could not read or write, while he was denied registration.

## On the Louisiana Situation

It is widely understood that the suffrage restrictions in Louisiana are designed to eliminate the negro vote. From Louisiana we learn:

It is *bitterly understood* that the negroes of that State, Louisiana, are no longer given the suffrage. In 1900 the population was 1,381,686, of whom 650,804 were negroes. By the census of 1910 the population was 1,656,388, of whom 695,766 were negroes. Thus the disproportion between white and black voters has been steadily increasing.

The result is that the disenfranchisement of intelligent property-holding negroes is shown by these figures from Louisiana:

1900-Population ..............1,381,686
1910-Total population .......1,656,388
1910-Illiterates ................106,265 
1910-Registered voters .......391,422

Yet the negroes of Louisiana have increased their relative numbers from one-half to three-fifths of the total population. With less than 400,000 voters at most the white oligarchy controls the State against the wishes of the negro masses.

Your special writer thinks that such disenfranchisement of the negro indicates "what the negro race must do." I think the "white folks are in the middle." What they are expected to do, *whatever the restrictions*, is to make a great effort to win over the negro to a loyal citizenship and Union. "This sounds easy and happy," but let us face a moment for some plain facts:

- Minnesota and Alabama each sent nine members to Washington in 1903. The First Congressional District in each State votes as follows:
  
  First Dist. Alabama ..............14,724
  First Dist. Minnesota ..........202,323

Now is it just that 1,000 voters in Alabama have the same power as 30,000 voters in Minnesota? "It is because 22,334 voters in the First District of Alabama were black and disfranchised, in spite of the fact that 60,000 of them could read and yet were prevented from voting, because there is a conspiracy afoot to get control of the polls in Alabama on which great issues are decided by the 'negro' question." 

"How is this for 'Democracy'? Verily, 'The hand is the hand of E. D. D., Director of Public Instruction, for the Advancement of Colored People.'"
