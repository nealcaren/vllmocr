## THE AIM

This paper will not be the champion of any "ism."

All rebel women are invited to contribute to its columns.

The majority of papers usually adjust themselves to the ideas of their readers but the WOMAN REBEL will obstinately refuse to be adjusted.

The aim of this paper will be to stimulate working women to think for themselves and to build up a conscious fighting character.

An early feature will be a series of articles written by the editor for girls from fourteen to eighteen years of age. In this present chaos of sex atmosphere it is difficult for the girl of this unsexed age to know just what to do or really what constitutes clean living without preachments. All this shady talk about white slavery, the mean paint and described as a hideous nature revolving round the blue young, pure and innocent girl, drugging her through the medium of grape juice and lemonade and then dragging her off to his foul den for there men equally as vicious to feed and fatten on her enforced slavery — surely this picture is enough to sicken and disgust every thinking woman and man, who has lived even a few years past the adolescent age. Could any more repulsive and foul conception of sex be given to adolescent girls as a preparation for life than this picture that is being perpetuated by the stupidly ignorant in the name of "sex education"?

If it were possible to get the truth from girls who work in prostitution to-day, I believe most of them would tell you that the first sex experience was with a sweetheart or through the desire for a sweetheart or something impelling within themselves, the nature of which they knew not, neither could they control. Society does not forgive the sexual impulse as feeding a young girl. It prefers the other story of the grape juice picture because it makes it easy to shift the blame from its own shoulders, to cause more and to evade the uncleanst facts that its alone is responsible for. It always intimates the trainer who usually holds the belt,  while theoretically it is supported by the merely inclined. 

If, as reported, there are approximately 35,000 women working as prostitutes in New York City alone, is it not sane to conclude that some force, some living, powerful, social force is at play to compel these women to work at a trade which involves 100 per cent. friction, social ostracism and the constant danger of exposure to venereal diseases. 

From our own knowledge of adolescent girls and from sincere expressions of women now working as prostitutes inspired by mutual understanding that we find it an easy task and the judicial neglect of the social welfare of girls is partly given, partly desired yet reluctantly to be accepted by the fear of consequences together with the dread of lost respect of the man. These fears interfere with the mutuality of expression — the man becomes conscious of the irresponsibility of the act and often refuses to be heard again, seldom leaving the town and usually disowning her as having been with "other fellows." His sole aim is to throw off responsibility. The same uncertainty in these emotions is experienced by girls in marriage in as great a proportion as in the unmarried. After the first experience the life of a girl varies.

All these girls do not necessarily go into prostitution. They have had an experience which has not "ruined" them, but rather given them a larger vision of life, stronger feelings and a broader understanding of human nature. The adolescent girl does not understand herself. She is full of contradictions, whims, emotions. For her emotional nature longs for caresses, touch, to kiss. She is often as well satiated to hold hands or to go arm in arm with a girl as in the companionship of a boy.

It is these and kindred facts upon which the WOMAN REBEL will dwell from time to time and from which it is hoped the young girl will derive some knowledge of her nature, and conduct her life upon such knowledge.

It will also be the aim of the WOMAN REBEL to advocate the prevention of conception and to impart such knowledge in the columns of this paper. 

Other subjects, including the slavery through motherhood; through things, the home, public press and so forth, will be dealt with.

It is also the aim of this paper to create among these women who work in prostitution; to voice their wrongs; to show what terrible pressure which hovers over them and give free expression to their thoughts, hopes and needs.

And at all times the WOMAN REBEL will staunchly advocate economic emancipation.

## THE NEW FEMINISTS

That apologetic tone of the new American feminist which painfully savvys "Really, Madam Public Opinion, we are all quite harmless and perfectly respectable" was the keynote of the first day and second mass meetings held at Cooper Union on the 17th and 20th of February last.

The ideas advanced were very old and time-worn even to the ordinary church-going woman who reads the magazines and comes in contact with current thought. The "right to work," the "right to ignore fashions," the "right to keep her own name," the "right to organize," the "right of the mother to work," all the so-called rights fail to arouse enthusiasm because to-day they are all recognized by society and there exist healthier notions of school life.

It is evident they represent a middle class woman's movement; a new, but a very weak and as yet, weak in organizational suffocating. Consideration of the working woman's freedom was ignored. The problems which affect the

working girl who slaves in the home or the nurse girl who spends her days and nights in the care of the babies of the feminists, were cast of devil upon. The freedom which the new feminist grounds can only be obtained through a brave and courageous act — through enslaved working woman, of "w're the slavery for their liberty cannot be." In- stead of launching a movement for wo- man's freedom the emphasis gained was that they aimed to combat the conventions of the conventional mis- suffragists.

To those who have been on the firing line for woman's freedom for the past several years, the new movement is really lacking in vitality, force, and conviction.

Any movement with fear lurking in the background, fear of the press, of public opinion, of our neighbor, or of the enemy, can not have that spirit which fearlessness of opposition brings, it is not for rights women should ask, All rights are here—rather it is for you to inculcate into her the desire to get these rights.

Feminists — Come out from under the cover of morbid respectability and let's get a look at you!

**WHY WAIT?**

MARION HOWARD

Workers of The World! Pause a few moments in self-imposed slavery! Pause!—can't you hear it? The rum- bling and muttering of an approaching storm the waters and magnitude of which you cannot gauge nor even com- prehend!

What is it? Why all this unrest? The fermentations all around me!

What means this listening, expectant attitude? It is the mutterings and undercurrents of thousands, yea millions of oppressed.

Hungrily and destitute, driven farther and farther away from the bare necess- ities of life they are listening, waiting, — Starving, toiling mass of humanity — For what?

They know not. Uncertain, dread- still with nervous tense, and hearts and minds emotioning. Waiting! For a match to set fire to the World of human manpower!

All over the world goes the cry for One Big Union to that vast purpose! The half starved Slave looks into the future and see nothing more than he has already had — Waiting!

What for! Why not the One Big Strike! To what purpose is One Big Union unless it can bring definite re- sult! Now not tomorrow.

Tomorrow the Capitalist shuts down his iron hand tighter, squeezing more wealth out, a little more out of life’s measures. Even on account of it we attempt in the name of Danger! The world is full of the good things of life, thousands of acres of fertile lands are lying idle! Take them — and now! Capitalists does it. — why not the worker, the producer, the men who fill the luxuries of life to the few.

Eight Hours a Day — a dollar an hour — the One Big Strike — anything — any — Why not it!

Delay may mean disruption and de- feat. Strike now the iron is hot!! Strike for the Universal Eight Hour — Victory!

**TO BE A WOMAN REBEL**

ELIZABETH KILLEN

The woman rebel's minor actions in life, her social media arrangements are free, flexible and original; the things that are unchangeable, are her principles, her ideals. With the homemaker and business, the ex- ideal knows and principles change con- stantly, her thoughts and her dress rarely. The woman rebel has strong and rooted conceptions, but so far ideal above it sometimes in bed, or on the roof or in a boat. She argues from the same fundamental principles.

But she does it anywhere; in bed or in bath or in a balloon. The present-day prevalence of good habits involves far great emphasis on those virtues on which only Custom can ensure and to place more emphasis on those virtues which Custom can ensure — sudden and splendid writers of inspiration; of no achievements; of lofty ambition. A working woman can get used to getting up at 5 or 6 o'clock, but how many can get used to being imprisoned for their convictions or shot at for their ideals! How many could be a Voltaire de Claye, a Louise Michel, an Emma Gold- man or an Elizabeth Flynn!

Let us all in the play of a little more attention to the possibilities of the heroic and the unexpected. It is only the rebel woman, when she gets out of the habits imposed on her by bourgeoisie conviction, who can do some deed of terrible virtue.

Yet there is one emphatic caution is be given to the woman who would defy the conventions. If the working woman does this, let her do it without a rag of excuse, without reason or justification to anyone. Let her be herself and live for her ideal and her convictions not for the approval or the op- plause of fashionable feminism. If she does try, however, for some secondary reason, from vanity or worldly ambi- tion, she may become a beggar in more senses than one.

**RULERS, JUDGES, SOLDIERS AND HANGMEN**

DOROTHY KELL

It is a hideous and lamentable ever an attempt. The mask of the judges, police, attorneys, are to exc- fices who bear and wicked or cruel— some of them are good and kind-hearted — not that they are stupid — several of them are quite intelligent, even some of those. It is simply that they have used it.

Strictly, the ruler does not use the individual virtue. The judge does not see the prisoner in the docket. The soldier does not see his brother. The hangmen does not see the condemned. And the shoot out the one woman in the usual place.

They do not see the horrible nature of their work. They only see the work clades.

The answer of the woman rebel is when the fist the sheet the judgments, the penitentials and the instrument of Man she shall upon each next stopped doomed is hoisted a new outlook the soul and spirit of Humanity.
