# THE WOMAN REBEL
*No Gods No Masters*

*Vol. 1, No. 1*

## THE AIM

The paper will not be so womanish as to go into hysterics over the present menstruation of inflamed sex cults. It will be sane, calm, self-possessed. 

The tendency of "reform" towards the esportic has been humorously obvious to the scholiast who has found himself preoccupied with the contemplation of contemporary somatic problems. Sex -- the sphynx [sic] -- has been the fertile source of numerous isms, quaint etymological crudities and synthetic philosophies. Each year, numerous [illegible] palsies have clutched the varied apostles of anarchy -- and it seems that each year, there has been a new schism, and a new rebellion against the rebellion, a new religion born of the withered [illegible] of ideals grown old.

The woman's rebellion against the century's old dictum is natural; it is logical; and above all is it relentless. For the rebellion was necessary in order to overthrow the idea contained in the masculine Code of ethics that the sole function of woman is toward sex and maternity. This code has governed the world for centuries. To him, nature gave the power of muscular superiority -- by which he has subdued her -- and in the spiritual realm he has subjugated her by laws and creeds. Her physical inferiority was proclaimed by her lord as an organic and natural law.

He has made her follow his nature, rather than her own deeper instinct of individuality. Her intellectual and spiritual freedom has been suppressed. The Woman Rebel shatters this vicious masculine concept of woman's sphere.

### THE NEW FEMINISTS

This paper takes for a comrade of rebellion the fertile-minded woman -- giving her views and expression and helping her develop de-sexed consciousness and an uncripling mentality. The majority of modern feminists lean towards a gospel of infantile rathymustic words, and a diffused eroticism, expressed in a varied key of sexualistic idioms. The Woman Rebel allies itself with the feminists like Sania Ranevskaya, Marie Jenney Howe, Ellen Key and Princess Lubov Jaikalehava Dragumiroff for a rebellion against the idea of sex itself in its relation to woman as an individual.

Visible text elements:

Headings:
- THE WIVES REMIL (large heading)
- WHY WAIT? (large heading)
- TO BE A WOMAN REBEL (large heading)

Body Text (paragraphs and bulleted lists):

- Bulleted list under "TO BE A WOMAN REBEL"

Other elements:
- Author names: "MARION HOWARD" and "ELIZABETH KLINE"
- Metadata text at the bottom: "Digitized by Google" and "UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA"

Visual hierarchy and layout:
- The image has a clear structure with large headings at the top, followed by body text in smaller font sizes.
- Under each heading, there are multiple paragraphs of text laid out in a typical book/article format.
- The "TO BE A WOMAN REBEL" section also includes a bulleted list.
- The author names are displayed prominently under their respective headings.
- Metadata is provided at the bottom of the image in a smaller font size.

Planned Markdown formatting approach:
- Use # for the large headings: THE WIVES REMIL, WHY WAIT?, and TO BE A WOMAN REBEL.
- Separate paragraphs with a blank line.
- Use - for the bulleted list under "TO BE A WOMAN REBEL".
- Preserve author names and metadata text as presented in the image.
- Describe the overall layout and structure briefly before the formatted text.

Challenges:
- Some text appears slightly blurred or pixelated, making certain words or characters difficult to read with absolute certainty. I will do my best to transcribe the text accurately, but may need to use [illegible] placeholders for any completely illegible portions.
- The text is densely packed, so preserving the formatting and structure will be crucial for readability in Markdown.

Reasoning for Markdown elements:
- Headings: Using # for large headings follows the standard Markdown convention and matches the visual hierarchy of the text in the image.
- Paragraphs: Separating paragraphs with a blank line is a common Markdown practice for improving readability.
- Bulleted list: The - symbol is the standard Markdown syntax for unordered (bulleted) lists.
- Preserving author names and metadata: Including these elements as presented in the image maintains the original context and attribution.

the [illegible] and contemptuous
spirit, the vulgar
and obscene are coarse, but the
coarse saves and defends both
herself and the race.
