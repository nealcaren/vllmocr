# 'GRANDFATHER CLAUSES.'

**Prof. Du Bois Tells of Discriminations Favoring Whites**

To the Editor of the New York Times: 

In the article on "Negroes Disfranchised," in THE TIMES of Oct. 80, your special writer says:

> The law prescribes the qualifications of all voters without regard to race, color, or previous condition; but the conditions are so hard that few colored voters can meet the tests required of them and—technically at least—required of all men.

This is not a fair statement of the case, by the well-known "grandfather clause." 

Ignorant white men have been used to the life-long hardship right to vote that citizens had acquired before the colored voters were registered. 

Further than that, qualified colored men and registration practically remain a farce of which no one can escape. 

I know this actually occurs, as illustrated by the following cases: A colored graduate of Harvard, who offered himself for registration in Virginia, writes me: 

> On the proper day I made application to the Registrar of the town of Hampton for registration. The Registrar was a young white man of the poorer class, showing a low degree of intelligence—a salesman, in a hardware store here in town. He handed me a piece of paper and told me to make out my application. This I did in proper form. He read it carefully and then handed me a sheet of paper containing five questions. Those questions asked the manner of election, term of office, and duties of some of the State officials not generally heard of. I answered all of the questions correctly with the exception of one, and that was particularly right; when I handed the paper back to him he looked at it for about a second and then, shaking his head, said: "You can’t register." 

I asked why, and he replied: "You haven’t answered these questions." I asked which were wrong. 

He answered impatiently: "I don’t have to tell you. I said you can’t register, and that settles it."

From Louisiana we learn: 

> It is firmly understood that the negroes cannot vote in the country parishes of Louisiana. Mr. Emmanuel Parsons of St. Mary’s Parish, Louisiana, is a graduate of Straight University. He is carrying on an undertaking business on his own farm, at $10,000, but he cannot participate in a vote. 

From North Carolina a friend writes: 

> The amendment, as you know, was not adopted for the improvement of the electorate, but rather to keep the negroes from voting—and the opposition among the dominant race and party is almost a greed toward educated Negroes. 

In the matter of voting, as toward any others—and these are naturally sensitive and little inclined to court trouble, simply do not register and vote. 

I think this element of the race in the State generally pay their poll tax, and at that point their paternalism stops. 

The result of the disfranchisement of intelligent property-holding negroes is shown by these figures from Louisiana: 

- **White**: 1900—Population: 728,612; 1908—Registered: 152,135

- **Negro**: 1900—Population: 178,834; 1908—Registered: 1,748

Yet the negroes of Louisiana have increased the value of their farms from nine and one-third to twelve and three-quarter millions assessed value for ten years, and despite the worst school system in America have reduced their illiteracy in the same time from 72 to 17 per cent. 

Your so-called “white folks” think that such a incident works no injury to the Negro. 

> The white folks are "up North," and say, "The South has no excuse for voting in this Union." This sounds gay and snappy; but let us for a moment face some plain facts; 

- Minnesota and Alabama each sent nine Congressmen to Washington in 1908. 

- The First Congressional District in each State votes as follows:

1. **Votes**: 
    - Pop. 
        - 1900: 
        - 1908: 

2. **First Dist. Alabama**: 
    - 151,724; 
    - 1,457.

3. **First Dist. Minnesota**: 
    - 602,161; 
    - 35,077.

How is it that 7,000 voters in Alabama have the same power as 39,000 in Minnesota?

Is it because 22,234 voters in the First District of Alabama were black and disfranchised, in spite of the fact that 1,900 of them could read and write; of the remaining 18,000 white voters who were interested enough to go to the polls?

Here is no political question, in Alabama on which people vote except the "negro" question.

How is this for Democracy in this blessed "Union"?
