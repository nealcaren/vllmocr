# THE WOMAN REBEL

**NO GODS NO MASTERS**

**VOL. I**  
**MARCH 1916**  
**NO. 1**

## THE AIM

This paper will be the champion of all the women who are tired to death of the existing state of affairs.

All the dumb and oppressed women of the world feel the need for a voice.

The purpose of this publication is to give expression to the WOMAN REBEL.

We shall be a voice in the world of thought.

We will endeavor to create a publication which will be the witness of the wish of the women, and will arouse in them the sense of their own worth and strength.

The condition of women is still such as to make impossible their being heard in the field of public opinion, even among women themselves.

We desire to be the mouthpiece of a new ideal of womanhood, and through this medium we will express the thought of women.

WOMAN REBEL is not merely a paper; it is the embodiment of the idea which will help women understand their own dignity, and therefore their capacity for development.

## THE NEW FEMINISTS

That splendid group of thinkers is the new feminism.

It is not based on the old ideals, merely dressing themselves in modern clothes. They desire to create a new world.

Instead of wasting words, they act.

WOMAN REBEL is dedicated to giving sound and reasoned utterances to the ideas of the women who desire something different from the usual.

> _To prevent ignorance and keep public opinion on a high level, we ask you to help us._

# THE WOMAN REBEL

## WHY WAIT? 
### MARJORY HOWARD

*Editors of The World*:

**Are you ready to put out a daring, bold, electric magazine of womenâ€™s living and thinking?**

*What is it?*

*Why wait?* This essential element of existence is just as vital as the courage to be a person.

*Not so long ago, women were afraid to express their original thoughts.*

They have been taught to be meek, submissive, and obedient to the rules of society.

*But now,* women are beginning to recognize their own originality and emerge from the shadows.

### TO BE A WOMAN REBEL 
### ELIZABETH KEN

*Desire means claiming oneself.* 

**This does not mean being selfish.**

It means embracing your identity without losing the value of others.

People must **learn** to appreciate the nuances of life, rather than attempting to conform to a single standard.

> *Your understanding is only as deep as your experiences.*

### ROBERT ELY

*It is a hard lesson to grasp.*

The world persists in pushing against the boundaries we think are established.

**What have we learned?** 

*Not all choices lead to genuine fulfillment.*

The essence of real freedom lies in choosing individuality over conformity.

Organized thought is often a structured approach but lacks emotional engagement.

*Therefore,* we must ask ourselves: 
1. What defines us as individuals?
2. How do we balance conformity with autonomy?

**The question doesn't end; it only begins.**
